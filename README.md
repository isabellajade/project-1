# Hot Tub Tour of California
## Project 1
For this project we set out to examine the AirBnb data of both Northern and Southern California to determine:

- What percentage of hot tubs are in each star-rating category?
- Is Northern or Southern California the most desireable region based on specific criteria?
- What are the best locations by review category?
- What are the price ranges for people with different budgets?

## About
The purpose of this project is to examine the AirBnb data of Northern and Southern California and make observations based on the data provided. By exploring the four questions above, we were able to determine that:

- Most of the Airbnbs fall within the 4 and 5-star categories.  4-star Airbnbs are far more prevalent and account for just over 73% of the properties.

- Southern California is the more desireable vacation destination if you are looking for an ideal hot tub airbnb stay. With 174 private hot tub, super-hosted, five-star airbnbs, Southern California far-exceeds the 24 locations presented in Northern California.
